# components of SaaS standards for operational requirements - 
1 . system availability
2. audit standards such as SSAE 16 (successor to SaaS 70)
3. Governmental compliance requirements - HIPPA or FINRA, or privacy addressed in the EU Data Protection Directive constitute

Barrier to Enterprise cloud adoption - 
1. Fear of security breaches
2. Issue with data soverienty
3. Lack of integration between application 

# When SaaS offerings were brought into the Enterprise without consideration of corporate governance and interoperability issues, 
# it was difficult to make everything “play together”.The developing standard requirements vary by industry and application – financial 
# and medical applications will typically have more rigorous standards than productivity applications.

Specific standard requirements includes - 
1) criticality of the application, 
2) the security, privacy and compliance requirements, 
3) the countries where the SaaS product be used, and 
4) the unique requirements of the specific Enterprise.

- Security
           User authentication and access control
           Protection against unauthorized access
           Code hardening and auditing
           Malware detection and remediation
           External threat such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense and Remediation
           Rights to audit the SaaS vendor’s operations and access log information
           Physical and personal security
           Protection of access by other tenants collocated in the same system
- Privacy
           ensure that the Enterprise’s customer privacy is protected in accordance with company policy and government regulations.
           Additionally, it is important for SaaS companies to take full advantage of EU Safe Harbor provisions to minimize the company’s 
           liability related to EU Privacy laws.
- Data Governance
           On-premise vendors needed to be sure that they had appropriate access control mechanisms to allow the customer to control 
           access to their data, ensure their APIs had appropriate controls, and encrypted data where necessary, but the management of 
           the data was the responsibility of the customer or their IT organization.
           Under the Cloud models, the SaaS vendor, often in partnership with their IaaS or PaaS suppliers have total responsibility for 
           safeguarding the data andd quality of the data.
- Availability (99.9999%) 
           Enterprise SaaS customers with critical requirements for availability will ensure they have access to their data in the 
           event of a failure of the SaaS vendor. In particular, they will want to have the ability for the SaaS vendor or an independent 
           third party such as Iron Mountain to have a disaster recovery (DR) plan in place to have access to their SaaS systems in the 
           event of a catastrophic failure including the bankruptcy of the company.
- Performance
- Interoperability
- Compliance 
           1) Industry specific compliance requirements such as HIPPA, FINRA, SOX, and various DoD requirements (U.S.) – these industry 
           standards are unique to each geopolitical area.
           2) Geopolitical compliance requirements such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), Korea/Taiwan Personal 
           Information Protection Act (PIPA), and India Information Technology Act (ITA) to name just a few.
           3) Enterprise specific requirements to meet the corporation’s internal IT standards such as Single Sign-On (SSO) and Authentication 
           standards.
           4) Compliance issues are related to Security and Privacy requirements, but have very specific governmental requirements, a broader 
           scope, and potentially higher damages.
