The two private networks need to talk to the internet for things like updating the operating system or installing software. Since the 
instances in the private network do not have a public IP, they need a NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway that can convert the 
private IP to public IP for routing traffic to the internet and back. AWS provides two kinds of NAT resources – NAT instances and NAT 
gateways. The gateways are completely managed by AWS and so they are preferred over NAT instances.

                  public subnet          private subnet

# Main job that Nat gateway - private subnet do not have an IP address, so the NAT gateway translates the private IP to a public IP before 
routing the traffic out to the internet.NAT stands for Network Address Translation and it does just that – translates private IPs to public IP.
SO route table contains rules for routing traffic within a subnet and from the subnet to outside world.

At the time of creating VPC, system creates default Route table which allows access to instances within the VPC. It does not allow access 
to instances outside the VPC. VPC has two layers of security: security groups and network ACLs.
