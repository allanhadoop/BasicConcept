The two private networks need to talk to the internet for things like updating the operating system or installing software. Since the 
instances in the private network do not have a public IP, they need a NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway that can convert the 
private IP to public IP for routing traffic to the internet and back. AWS provides two kinds of NAT resources â€“ NAT instances and NAT 
gateways. The gateways are completely managed by AWS and so they are preferred over NAT instances.
