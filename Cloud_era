# Performance, cost and agility important 
# Well-architected AWS suggest to do following 
Amazon CloudWatch monitoring: Use CloudWatch to monitor instances.
- Third-party monitoring: Use third-party tools to monitor systems.
- Periodic review: Periodically review your monitoring dashboards.
- Alarm-based notifications: Receive an automatic alert from your monitoring systems if metrics are out of safe bounds.
- Trigger-based actions: Alarms cause automated actions to remediate or escalate issues.
- SIzing of the instance is more important, it should not be under or over provisioned .. 

Elastic Beanstalk (EBS), for example, is the platform as a service (PaaS) offering from AWS. The promise to developers is that they 
can focus on application code, while Elastic Beanstalk handles every stage of deployment: from capacity provisioning, load balancing, 
auto-scaling to monitoring the health of the application

# Developers must decide which metric is most important to them. How do they make this decision? No application requires just CPU or 
just Memory or just Storage or just Network and so onâ€”contention in any of those resources will cause performance degradation
