private subnet
public subnet - IGW+Elastic ip

ssh to public subnet instance and then ssh to instance in private subnet
route table created due to vpc will let each subnet resource talk to each other
create IGW and assign it to vpc . we will late assign it to public subnet
so we need IGW and (either load balancer or elastic ip address) for resource to have access to
internet that are launched in this public subnet.


So we need route to road(IGW) and tie that route to subnet (public) so now, any resource we
launch in this subnet can have either elastic load balancer or elastic ip and then it will communicate
to internet

launch ec2(need bigger size to choose dedicated vpc) in public subnet and then assign elastic ip to it.
So now we have resource in public and private subnet. Issue is we need to first connect to public subnet resource
and then ssh to resource of private subnet.make sure to copy keypair file to private resource

scp -i developer.pem developer.pem ec2-user@XX.XX.XX.XXX:~/   This is to copy from local to public instance
Now connect to private instance.
